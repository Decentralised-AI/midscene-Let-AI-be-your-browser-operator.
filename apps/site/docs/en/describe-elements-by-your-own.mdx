# Describe Elements by Your Own

In some cases, you may want to describe elements by yourself. For example, you may want to describe the content inside an `<canvas />` element which cannot be extracted by Midscene. Or you just want to "be friendly" to the LLM.

To do this, you can put an identifier in the `midscene-description-ref` attribute, and put the description JSON in a `<script>` tag with the same identifier. Midscene will take use these descriptions to feed the LLM.

For example:

```html
<canvas style="width: 80px; height: 80px; background: #AC0;" midscene-description-ref="ac7"></canvas>
<script type="text/json" midscene-description-id="ac7">
  [{
    "rect": {
        "x": 20,
        "y": 20,
        "width": 20,
        "height": 20
    },
    "text": "Rule of the game",
    "description": "This is a description of the rule of the game"
  }, {
    "rect": {
        "x": 60,
        "y": 60,
        "width": 20,
        "height": 20
    },
    "description": "This is a lucky draw button"
  }]
</script>
```

The core fields are `rect`, `text`, and `description`.

- `rect`: The rectangle of this content. Required. All the coordinates are relative to the upper left corner of the element.
- `text`: The text of this content. Optional. Should be same as the text on screen.
- `description`: A short description of this content. Optional.
